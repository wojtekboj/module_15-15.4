## General info
Exercises with ES6

## Tasks
First task
The combination of two strings using the + operator is a very easy task. Another way is to use the concat or join 
method, but what if we could not use any of these options? Your task will be to create two variables with Hello 
and World values, and then combine them with a method other than those mentioned above.

Second task
Create a multiply function that will return the result of the multiplication operation of two values ​​a and b. 
For example:

multiply (2, 5) // 10<br>
multiply (6, 6) // 36<br>
The task seems to be simple, but what if the user gives only one value on the input? For example:

multiply (5) //?<br>
We want the result of such a call to be also correct - you can assume that if the user does not provide any of 
the parameters, it is to be replaced. 1. Do not use conditional instructions! Create the function using the 
arrow function.

Task three
Write an average function that calculates the arithmetic mean of all arguments that will be passed to it. Assume 
that the arguments will always be numbers:

average (1) // 1<br>
average (1, 3) // 2<br>
average (1, 3, 6, 6) // 4<br>
Take advantage of the rest parameters! Create the function using the arrow function.

Task four
Create an array with grad grades = [1, 5, 5, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1] grades, and then skillfully pass the grades to 
the average function to get the result. Use the spread operator!

Task five
While working on the project, you came across a very strange data structure - [1, 4, 'Iwona', false, 'Nowak']. 
Your task is to use destructuring to get the firstname and lastname variables from the array.
